This is an ecommerce website that sell brimless hat. This website using vue js (vuex for state management, and vue-router), and vuetify for the front-end. For the back-end side, I use mongoDB, mongoose, bcrypts (for hashing password), jsonwebtoken (for session authentication), express. Also in this repository for back-end, I implement mocha, chai, and chai-http for testing.
